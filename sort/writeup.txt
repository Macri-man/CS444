I found that for varying threads constant number of files and number of lines in files. The more thread
you will have the faster the program will run. But will not go any faster if the number ot threads is 
greater than number of files.

I found that for constant threads and files with varying number of lines in file. With more lines the 
program will take more time for the program to complete.

I found that for constant threads and lines with varying of files. More files greatly increases the time 
the program to complete.

How does the number of threads impact execution time as the line numbers vary?
The time to program runs increases but only when the lines increase.
How does the number of threads impact execution time as the number of files vary?
The time to program runs increases greatly with a huge number of files.
